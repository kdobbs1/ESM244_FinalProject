LC,least concern,"When a species is classified as LC, or least concern, IUCN has deemed the species as not being a focus of species conservation because the specific species is still plentiful in the wild."
VU,vulnerable,"When a species is classified as VU, or vulnerable, IUCN has deemed that the species meets one of the 5 Red List criteria and thus considered to be at high risk of unnatural (human-caused) extinction without further human intervention. The 5 Red List Criteria include population reduction, restricted geographic range, small population size and decline, very small or restricted population and extinction probability analysis."
